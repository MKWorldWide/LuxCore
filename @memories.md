### 🔄 Session Progress
- **Phase 1:** Project initialization and structure setup
- **Phase 2:** NovaSanctum technology integration
- **Phase 3:** Core functionality implementation
- **Phase 4:** Documentation and testing
- **Phase 5:** Deployment and optimization

### 💡 Key Insights
- Starting with clean slate allows for optimal architecture design
- NovaSanctum technology will be integrated at the core level
- Quantum documentation will be maintained throughout development
- Security-first approach with modern best practices

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Project Structure
- Adopted monorepo architecture for better code sharing and management
- Separated concerns: backend (API), frontend (UI), shared (types/utils), infrastructure (deployment)
- Used workspaces for dependency management

### 2. Technology Choices
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Security**: NovaSanctum for advanced authentication and authorization
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL support
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom NovaSanctum theme

### 3. Security Implementation
- NovaSanctum service for both backend and frontend
- Advanced token management with refresh tokens
- Session management with security monitoring
- Audit logging for compliance
- Rate limiting and security headers

### 4. Development Setup
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Husky for git hooks
- Comprehensive testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library

## Current Status
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Package.json files configured
- ✅ TypeScript configurations set up
- ✅ NovaSanctum services implemented
- ✅ Basic UI components created
- ✅ Context providers implemented
